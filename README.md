## Dataset Setup

Due to GitHub file size limits, datasets are hosted in Google Drive. Each client in the FL setup accesses a disjoint dataset stored in their respective Drive folders:

- Client 1 (Arundhathi): [Google Drive - all_classes](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bnSukJc5KV4sEsh5C3zBdfDxxy00fOaw?usp=drive_link)
- Client 2 (Ishika): [Google Drive - Joined Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XTrXzDh4EgCEeLZocV-tKvx8cM2GiJai?usp=drive_link)
- Client 3 (Nasih): [Google Drive - Mixed Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1klKPNzC-AEsrh7XNg7qWvyFOmPPJPkC2?usp=drive_link)
